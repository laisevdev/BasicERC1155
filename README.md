# Basic Token ERC-1155 Project

The ERC-1155 token standard is a smart contract standard on the Ethereum platform that defines an interface for the efficient creation and management of multiple types of fungible (equal) and non-fungible (unique) tokens in a single contract. This standard was proposed by Enjin, a company that focuses on blockchain-based games, to improve the efficiency and flexibility of tokenization operations.
The main feature of the ERC-1155 standard is the ability to group different types of tokens into a single contract, which can lead to significant savings in terms of gas costs (transaction fees) and load on the Ethereum network.

I created this simple project with the aim of improving my knowledge in a more active way.
To create it, I used the following tools:

- Hardhat;
- OpenZeppelin;
- Javascript;
- Solidity;
- Mumbai Testnet (Polygon Network).
